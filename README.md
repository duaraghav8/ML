# ML
Code I wrote in order to illustrate Machine Learning Algorithms using input features in mostly 2 dimensional space (could easily be extended to any number of dimensions, its just the visualization that becomes harder which is why I didn't go beyond 2). The code is intended to make developers understand how learners based on Neural Networks, Bayesian learning, Decision Trees and Concept learning algorithms actually work.

ps - Check out Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell. For ML Junkies (like me), it is GOLD!
